# Python-Challenge
Here is code to perform the requested homeworks.
Given where I started, I'm pleased it's working.
I was helped immensely by a combination of talking to a coding-adept coworker and Google.
My Colleague was able to point me in the direction of the Collections dependency, and from there, the Counter. I wouldn't have progressed on PyPoll without those.
My colleague was also instrumental in helping me unlock the power of lists.
Lastly, nothing solves Python problems quite as fast as judicious use of THE GOOGLE. I was able to find all kinds of helpful tips and tricks from a bunch of different resources and could cobble together a solution by seeing code that solved similar problems, which helped me talk to my colleague, which honed a solution.
